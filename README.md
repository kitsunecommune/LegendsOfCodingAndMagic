# GOAL
Draft a deck of cards, battle an opponent with those cards and reduce their Health Points (HP) from 30 to 0.
## Rules
This game is a two-player card game which is played in two phases: the Draft phase and the Battle phase.
During the Draft phase, both players must create a deck of 30 cards.
Once the Draft phase is over, both decks are shuffled.
During the Battle, the board is divided in two parts: each player plays cards from their hand on their side of the board.
Each player starts with 30 HP. Some cards can increase this number.
To reduce the health points of an opponent, the player must make use of cards to deal damage.

### Draft Phase
For 30 turns, both players are given a choice between 3 different cards. Players select the card they want to add to their deck by using the PICK command followed by 0, 1 or 2.
By default, the PASS command will pick the first card.
Both players can select the same card, they will each receive a copy.
### Battle Phase
Card Draw
First player starts with 4 cards in hand whereas the second player starts with 5.
Each turn, the active player draws one additional card from their deck.
Some cards can make players draw additional cards at the beginning of the next turn when played.
Both players possess runes which have an impact on card draw. However, runes should be ignored until the Bronze league.

#### Mana
Mana is necessary to play cards from the hand.
The first player starts with 1 max mana, the second with 2 max mana.
Each player can spend as much mana per turn as they have max mana.
The second player receives his +1 max mana bonus until he spends all his mana during a turn.
Each turn, the active player is granted one additional max mana, unless they already have 12 max mana (13 for the second player who didn't spend his bonus).
#### Card Types
There are two different types of cards: Creatures and Items.


##### Creatures
Placing a creature card from the hand to the board is called summoning.
A player summons creatures to their side of the board by paying their cost in mana. They are used to attack the opponent and also serve as a defense against the creatures of the opposing player.
Creatures have a cost in mana, attack points and defense points. Some creatures start with certain abilities.
By default, creatures can't attack the turn they are summoned. They can attack once per turn only.
When a creature attacks another one, they both deal damage equals to their attack to the defense of the other creature. When a creature attacks the opponent, it deals damage equals to its attack to the HP of the opponent.
Creatures are removed from play when their defense reaches 0 or less.
Creatures can have an effect on the player's health, the opponent's health or the card draw of the player when played.

Creatures can have different abilities:
	*Breakthrough*: Creatures with Breakthrough can deal extra damage to the opponent when they attack enemy creatures. If their attack damage is greater than the defending creature's defense, the excess damage is dealt to the opponent.
	*Charge*: Creatures with Charge can attack the turn they are summoned.
	*Guard*: Enemy creatures must attack creatures with Guard first.
##### Items

When played, items have an immediate and permanent effect on the board or on the players. They are then removed from play.
Items have a cost in mana and one or multiple effects out of the following:
Permanent modifier of a creature's attack and/or defense characteristics. Example: +0/+2 or -1/-1.
The addition or removal of one or more abilities to one creature.
Additional card draw the next turn they're played.
Health gain for the player or health loss for the opponent.
There are three types of items:
	*Green items* should target the active player's creatures. They have a positive effect on them.
	*Red items* should target the opponent's creatures. They have a negative effect on them.
	*Blue items* can be played with the "no creature" target identifier (-1) to give the active player a positive effect or cause damage to the opponent, depending on the card. Blue items with negative defense points can also target enemy creatures.
